Eddie O'Hara

"Try as I may, I really cannot come up with a punchy few words which would do justice to how to best describe Stephanie's special, unique and positive impact upon those children and adults she works with, cares for and is committed to. Stephanie's enthusiasm, kindness, knowledge, expertise and continual postitive affirmation of of others is both envigorating and enabling. Stephanie is one of the genuinely lovely professionals I have bbeen lucky enough to meet along the way. My team and I loved working with Stephanie and genuinely look forward to doing so again. I cannot recommened Stephanie high enough :)"

Tristana Rodriguez

"The first thing I would say about Steph's training is that her knowledge and passion for her subject shine through, but above all, her breadth of experience. Safeguarding roles are stressful in their nature and the training can often feel heavy, but Steph had so many lovely, child-centred examples, it kept in mind why we do what we do. All of this was packaged up in the legislation and best practice we need to do the roles to the best of our ability. I came out of the training energised to do better and am hugely grateful."
